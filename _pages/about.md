# Bio

I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Waterloo, as a member of the Neurocognitive Computing Lab (Neurocog Lab), with Prof. Jeff Orchard. I completed a Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Computer Engineering and Computational Mathematics. The main focus of my research is on Neural Networks, specifically on bi-directional models. The model learns to both predict accurately and generate believably. Like other neural network models, my research has inspired by the brain. I have worked on neural engineering framework to build the model. Then I moved on building the platform from scratch.

Moreover, I have worked on an optimization problem. As a side project, I developed an application for stock trading purposes. It makes an optimized portfolio out of given stock symbols subjects to restrictions such as budget, risk level. The app improves decision making and market analysis, mainly in the passive mode.

In terms of publication, I published a conference paper during my master's and have some journal papers pertinent to Ph.D. research. Recently, I wrote a handbook through the literature review on artificial neural networks and energy-based models. I wrote tips & tricks notes on Algorithm, Data Structure, Linear Algebra, Number Theory, Statistic, and Probability.

In addition to research, I am actively learning new things and trying to expand my knowledge in other fields, such as pedagogical skills. I have done teaching assistant and tutor in different courses from calculus, linear algebra numerical analysis, neural network, computational linear algebra so far. Right now, I am organizing the lab meeting, planning tutorials, and assisting Intro to AI's course instructor. I grow up in Tehran and finish high school, undergrad, and master there. Later I joined the industry and worked as a computer engineer for several years. When I moved to Canada, I started a master of mathematics in Computational Mathematics. Later, I began my research in the doctoral program in Neural Networks & Machine Learning, which is my favorite. And this trend will continue.
