I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Waterloo, as a member of the Neurocognitive Computing Lab (Neurocog Lab), with Prof. Jeff Orchard. I completed a Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Computer Engineering and Computational Mathematics. The main focus of my research is on Neural Networks, specifically on bi-directional models. The model learns to both predict accurately and generate believably. Like other neural network models, my research has inspired by the brain.
