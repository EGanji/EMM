Here's some basic test.

And here's some *italics*

Here's some **bold** text.

what about a [link](http://github.eganji/)

Here's a bulleted list:
* First item
+ Second item
- Third item


Here's a numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python code block:
'''python
	import numpy as np

	def test(x):
	print(x)
	return x
'''

R code block:
'''r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("some_file.csv")
head(df)
'''

Here's some inline code 'x+y'.

Here's some image
<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/zfnet.png" alt="linearly seperable data" width="800" height="400">

Here's another image using Kramdown:

![alt]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/zfnet.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
